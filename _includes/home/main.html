                            <p>I'm a graphic designer, front-end developer and tech writer. I've been a graphic design student at HAN University of Applied
                                Sciences and I graduated in February, 2019.</p>
                            <p>I love typographic design, 3D modeling, photography,
                                making videos, motion graphics and doing creative things with graphics. In addition to that I'm also interested in web
                                development, setting up Linux servers & creating games in Unity.

                                Knowing that I both love graphic design and tech stuff, I chose to become a front-end developer. A front-end developer builds websites according to a design given by a web designer. It's exactly on the edge of design and tech.
