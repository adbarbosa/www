# Personal Website

This repository contains the source code of my personal website.

# Challenge

The challenge is to build a website that... 

- Looks clean and professional
- Is open source
- Is easy to maintain
- Is built with nice, easy to understand frameworks (Zurb Foundation, Jekyll)
- Is light enough to host on GitHub Pages

# Improvements

I am human. I make mistakes.  I learn from them. Seeing something that could be improved? Send me a pull request!

I am looking forward to seeing your input.
