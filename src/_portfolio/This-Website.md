After I [graduated](/portfolio/vormkracht10-ux) for my Bachelor of Science in Communication &amp; Multimedia Design, I needed to work on both my online presence and my career towards being a front-end developer. To achieve it, I began working on this project.

# The struggle.

I'm currently applying for a job as front-end developer, but I'm having a hard time with it.

I've had some experience with front-end in the past, thanks to my former employers, but the products I worked on are closed source. I have some graphical design related stuff to show, but just no front-end stuff. How could I ensure them that I know how to use a 12 columns grid system? That I understand Javascript as if it's my mother tongue? That I know how to use continious integration tools like Travis CI? That I know how to use bundlers like webpack? I couldn't, and I wanted to change it.

I want to **show my skills** and to **have something that's entirely mine**. I love beautiful graphics and to occasionally write about graphic design and geeky sh\*t. So that's where this project started.

# Goal.

Every project starts with a global goal. My main goal was quite personal and I've written it down. Here it is:

> I want the world to be able to see who I am, what I love, what I do (professionally) and which skills I have.

To achieve this, I derived this main goal to a few sub goals.

## Sub goals

**1** &emsp; I want to create my own blogging/portfolio system, something that is easy to maintain and something I   regularly update. &mdash; I need to be able to write articles regardless from wherever the f\*ck I am, just with a simple text editor and GitHub. No plugins, no other b\*llsh\*t.

**2** &emsp; I want to occasionally write about the things I love and do &mdash; The graphic design related stuff and the tech stuff.

**3** &emsp; I want to help others learn from me, and I want to learn from others. &mdash; My website needs to be open source.

**4** &emsp; I want to work towards an international career. &mdash; So the stuff on my website should be in English.

**5** &emsp; I want my parents to stop thinking I'm wasting my time watching Netflix all day. &mdash; Which I'm not. &mdash; But how the f\*ck could they know I were working on this project all day lately. I didn't tell them. _Oops_.

# What's next?

My new website is finished. It just needs 'some polishing' on the technical parts, and I'm eager to regularly fill the blog and portfolio with updated content. And... I'm ready to show something that's mine while I'm applying for new jobs. Yay.

# Where's the source code?

It's on [GitHub](https://github.com/ellipticcurv3/personal-website).

<small>_Oh, and I probably should also write a README, so people know how to run it locally._</small>
