                            <p>I'm a digital designer, front-end developer and blogger. I've studied Communcation &amp;
                                Multimedia Design at HAN University of Applied Sciences and obtained my Bachelor of
                                Science in February, 2019.</p>
                            <p>I have an intense love for UX/UI design, front-end web development and photography.
                                Knowing that I both love graphic design and technology, I chose to combine those
                                passions.</p>
                            <p>On my blog, you could learn more about the things I'm doing. There's also a portfolio
                                available showing an overview of projects I worked on in the past.</p>
