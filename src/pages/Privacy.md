So, here is my super short privacy statement.

## Nice to know

- I run my own server.
- I collect as little information as possible. (e.g. I do not collect any _access_ logs.)
- I will not share and/or sell your information.

## but...

- I collect _error_ logs. (All non-4xx status codes).
- Some integrations (like Disqus) could be collecting information about you.

## &amp;...

- We could be living in a simulation.
- I might sell your kidney instead.
