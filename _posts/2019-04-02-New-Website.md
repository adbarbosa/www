After I [graduated](/portfolio/vormkracht10-ux) for my Bachelor of Science in Communication &amp; Multimedia Design, I needed to work on my online presence and my career towards being a front-end developer. So I [created my own website]({{site.baseurl}}/portfolio/my-website).

I wanted to create a website that's easy to maintain, open source and gives an impression of who I am, what I do and what my ambitions are. All content of my website will be in English because it reaches more people than when it would be written in Dutch.

# What is going to be found on this site?

On the blog I will write about a variety of subjects, assorted into appropiate categories. Some things one could think of are articles regarding graphic design, front-end development, computer software, electronics, conferences etc.

The portfolio shows an impression of the projects I've worked on in the past.

# ... and how long did it take?

About 6 weeks.

- 1 week for the 'ideation phase' (or 'brainstorm', 'project outline', 'information architecture', 'initial sketches')
- 2 weeks for the more fine-grained designs ('design considerations', 'wireframes', 'alternative approaches')
- 3 weeks for the development ('writing the code')

But remember, it is *an ongoing project*, so I will keep working on it and it will never be 'finished'. Anyways, it took ~6 weeks before the first version went live.



# ... so why don't you use WordPress or a similar blogging platform?

There are many, many reasons.

- **Geekyness** &mdash; I'm a geek.
- **Coolness** &mdash; Using WordPress would not be as cool as saying that I created all this stuff on my own.
- **Expandability** &mdash; I can expand my website with fancy stuff when I want to.
- **Collaboration** &mdash; Others could help (re)write parts of my articles by sending a pull request on GitHub. I learn from others, others learn from me.
- **Awesomeness** &mdash; Git is awesome. Especially when you like to work on stuff with an iterative approach. Create a branch and go.
- **Proudness** &mdash; I'm just proud of taking different approaches and to create something out of nothing. That's probably part of my character.



# What's next?

The next thing is to maintain this website, add new blog articles and portfolio content.
